Three things that learned from this assignment

- need to specify the problem/issue we want to solve
- not to rely on ai assistant blindly
- breakdown the problem in small pieces and use prompt to solve step by step

To get accurate suggestions from Copilot, I start by providing some input first. As I begin typing, it suggests code that closely matches what I’m looking for. This approach helps me write code faster and more efficiently.

I found the ask mode is more efficient for learning, as it helps me to understand the logic behind the code and improve my problem-solving skills through interactive explanation. I use the ask mode more often than the agent mode. When I'm unsure about a piece of generated code, I asked for the explanation. I also use the ask mode for styling the skills section and projects section to guide me with the CSS.

Three risks of relying too much on AI tools when learning at HackYourFuture:

- AI-generated solution will making it harder to write code and debug independently
- Slowdown the long-term skill development and deeper understanding
- Reduce the practical experience
